    Computes the evolution of the reproduction number R for counties on a graph.

    Chambolle-Pock algorithm). Hyperparameters choice has to be as followed :
    - mu R sets piecewise linearity of Rt
    - mu S sets spatial regularity of Rt on the chosen graph which transposed incidence matrix is 'B_matrix'.
